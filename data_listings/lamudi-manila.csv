878 Espana | Condominium near UST
España Boulevard is also a connecting district to Quezon City and Makati City, the central business district (CBDs) that house several young professionals in the country. As CBD areas contain high-value properties, España Boulevard is an alternative to the middle-income professionals who want to live in a value-for-money condominium property while pursuing their passions, making the area bustling and thriving. The real estate market in España Boulevard is booming. Currently, there are fewer condominium properties in the district than the neighboring ones. However, condo prices have been soaring in the past few years – yet values are still more affordable compared to the rest of Southeast Asia.

Heading to college or university often means finding a place to live independently. 878 Espana by Vista Residences upgrades every student’s living experience by serving as a home away from home where they can study, work, play and live after a tough day running in between class or completing a project in school. 878 Espana by Vista Residences is not your usual college address. The perfect lifestyle makes student condo living much more accessible and fun.
