Each condominium unit has a thru-view living and dining area that provides city view on one side and golf course view on the other. Each tower has its own helipad on its roof for use by its residents as well as for emergency evacuation purposes. The North Tower has an undulating curve as its facade; the South Tower is shaped like a crescent. Each tower incorporates a sheer wall on its narrow end that wraps up over the rooftop; this not only adds visual drama, but also conceals mechanical equipment housed on the roof. Contrasting eyebrow configurations on each building create a dynamic juxtaposition of visual elements. The complex includes an atrium space with a skylight; a meditation room for residents’ use overlooks the lush, landscaped garden and waterfall that front the property. \n\nHead now to HousingInteractive and let us assist you in having this property.", "project_unit": null, "project_name": null, "area": null, "floor_area": "300 sqm", "price": "₱ 110,000,000", "location": "Fort Bonifacio, Taguig", "bedrooms": "3 bedrooms", "bathrooms": "4 bathrooms", "floor": "45", "condition": "Partly furnished", "property_type": "Condo", "offer_type": "For Sale", "construction_year": null, "parking_spaces": "2", "ownership_type": null, "project_link": null, "publish_date": "4 Jul 2025", "publish_by": "HousingInteractive Inc."}
