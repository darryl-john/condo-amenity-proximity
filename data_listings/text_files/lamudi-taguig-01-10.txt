While other comparable properties command much higher prices, Cypress Tower delivers the same quality and prime location at a fraction of the cost, making it the smartest investment choice for BGC professionals. The strategic location means shorter commutes, lower transportation costs, and more time to enjoy your cozy balcony views. Don't let this rare opportunity slip away - units at this price point with such convenient BGC and airport accessibility are extremely limited and won't last long in today's competitive real estate market.\n\n\n#CypressTower #2BedroomCondo #BGCAccessible #AffordableCondo #10PercentDP #50KReservation #BankFinancing #RareOffer #CondoForSale #BGCWorkers #AirportAccess #CozyBalcony #RealEstatePhilippines #CondoDeals #MoveInReady #LowDownPayment #PropertyInvestment #BGCVicinity #AffordableHousing #CondoLiving #RealEstate #PropertyForSale #HomeSweetHome #DreamHome #CondoUnit", "project_unit": "Cypress Towers", "project_name": "Cypress Towers", "area": "51 sqm", "floor_area": "51 sqm", "price": "₱ 3,830,000", "location": "Bagong Tanyag, Taguig", "bedrooms": "2 bedrooms", "bathrooms": "1 bathroom", "floor": null, "condition": null, "property_type": "Condo", "offer_type": "For Sale", "construction_year": null, "parking_spaces": null, "ownership_type": null, "project_link": "https://www.lamudi.com.ph/projects/cypress-towers/", "publish_date": "2 weeks, 6 days ago", "publish_by": "iAM Nancy.PRC.DHSUD ACCREDITED 2025 TEAM INFINITE"}
