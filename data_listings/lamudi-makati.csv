The tower rises to approximately 210 m with 60 aboveground floors and 4 belowground levels (some sources note minor discrepancies up to 62 above‑ground plus 5 sub‑levels).Designed as a high-end condominium, the units span a variety of floor plans and sizes. Though specific unit mix data is limited, the building’s layout and high ceiling heights speak to residential comfort and luxury appeal. The design inspiration reflects the upscale London neighborhood of Knightsbridge, signaling sophistication and elegance
.The Knightsbridge Residences delivers a harmonious blend of architectural distinction, luxurious amenities, and a premium location. From glowing glass facades to high‑ceilings and resort‑inspired facilities, the project exemplifies upscale residential urbanism in Metro Manila. Its proximity to commercial corridors, cultural nodes, and transport access makes it both a lifestyle statement and a smart investment.

Overview of the Project
This multi-tower project spans approximately 1.7 hectares and features residential suites, hotel-condo units, spa facilities, retail spaces, and wellness amenities, making it one of the first of its kind in the Philippines. Conceived in the mid‑2000s, Antel’s vision was to introduce a luxury wellness lifestyle within Makati’s urban core—an integrated resort-like condo-hotel where residents can live, relax, and rejuvenate without leaving home.

The towers showcase modern, clean-lined facades with high-quality finishes, creating a striking presence along Makati Avenue. Large windows and balconies provide abundant natural light and sweeping views of Makati’s skyline and surrounding neighborhoods.

makati,15,studio unit  for SALE near AMA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE in Makati,"A studio condo unit at Manchester Place is now available for sale at an attractive price, offering exceptional proximity to AMA School. This prime location presents a unique opportunity for medical students to invest in property that directly supports their academic journey.
The benefits for medical students are substantial. Living so close to campus eliminates daily commute stress and transportation costs, giving you more time for studying and easy access to school facilities during extended study sessions. You'll find it convenient for clinical rotations and early morning classes, with the ability to quickly return between classes for rest or meals. Financially, you'll build equity instead of paying rent with no return, with potential for rental income from roommates or during breaks. This represents a long-term investment that can appreciate in value while avoiding landlord restrictions and sudden rent increases, plus you'll enjoy tax benefits of property ownership.
From a lifestyle perspective, you'll have complete privacy and control over your living environment with the ability to customize your space for optimal studying. There are no shared living concerns with non-medical students, providing a quiet environment conducive to medical studies with ample storage space for medical books and equipment.

For serious inquiries and viewing appointments, please contact me. Remember, investment in your education deserves investment in your living situation.

makati,22,"2 Bedroom For Sale in Easton Place, Makati City","Easton Place  
Overview of the Project 
Easton Place, completed in 1987, is a single-tower high-rise standing around 37 floors tall. Developed and owned by Vernida Realty, it features spacious layouts within one of Makati’s most prestigious neighborhoods. Easton Place remains a trusted, mid‑rise classic in Salcedo Village, cherished for its spacious layouts, time-tested amenities, and rock‑solid security. Its location offers direct access to urban conveniences—malls, cafés, top schools, hospitals, and green walkways—making it ideal for families, professionals, and long-term residents seeking a balanced lifestyle in central Makati.

Key Building Features:
Architectural Design: Easton Place was designed by Wong & Tung International Ltd, a Hong Kong-based architectural firm known for residential, commercial, and mixed-use developments across Asia. Their portfolio includes high-rise structures that balance functionality with contemporary elegance.

Unit Configurations: 
Easton Place distinguishes itself through its entirely mid- to large-sized units—two bedrooms (125 sqm) and three bedrooms (189 sqm)—each offering maid's room and balconies, making them rare urban homes with comfort, functionality, and space lacking in newer, denser developments.

Modern Finishes: Easton Place in Salcedo Village, Makati, may have been constructed in the late 1980s, but its interiors—particularly in upgraded units—reflect a thoughtful transition into modern living. Many residents and investors have recognized the value of its generous floor plans and have chosen to renovate with contemporary aesthetics, smart layouts, and updated fixtures. The result is a blend of timeless spatial design with finishes that match today’s standards of urban sophistication.
One of the most prominent features in many upgraded units is the flooring. Original parquet wood floors have either been restored or replaced with high-quality engineered wood or vinyl planks in soft, earthy tones.

 Welcome to Two Roxas Triangle !
 

 Roxas Triangle Towers is a two-tower development piercing the skyline at the heart of a great city.
 

 The Two Roxas Triangle units are also clear manifestations of its rarity. The entire 52-level tower only contains a total of 182 units. Its exclusivity is even raised by several notches as each floor only has four units in comparison with a typical high-end building that has about 10 to 12 units.
 

 The smallest unit at the tower is 302 sq m, and the biggest cut expands all the way to 550 sq m. Furthermore, the tower’s garden level has two units. Standard units are then located from the fourth to the 41st floor. Higher than these floors is what the developers call the sky units. Beyond the sky are the penthouses, four of which are bi-level and three are flats.
 

 The design of Two Roxas Tower is consistent with the first tower—the unit layouts to an extent the façade design.

Ultra-Luxury Bi-Level Penthouse For Sale in Two Roxas Triangle, Makati City




Welcome to Two Roxas Triangle!




Roxas Triangle Towers is a two-tower development piercing the skyline at the heart of a great city.




The Two Roxas Triangle units are also clear manifestations of its rarity. The entire 52-level tower only contains a total of 182 units. Its exclusivity is even raised by several notches as each floor only has four units in comparison with a typical high-end building that has about 10 to 12 units.




The smallest unit at the tower is 302 sq m, and the biggest cut expands all the way to 550 sq m. Furthermore, the tower’s garden level has two units. Standard units are then located from the fourth to the 41st floor. Higher than these floors is what the developers call the sky units. Beyond the sky are the penthouses, four of which are bi-level and three are flats.




The design of Two Roxas Tower is consistent with the first tower—the unit layouts to an extent the façade design.

One Rockwell West Tower is a residential condominium located in Rockwell Center, Makati, Philippines. It is one of two towers in the One Rockwell complex, with the West Tower being the taller of the two. The building is known for its distinctive curvilinear design, with two halves that appear to slide away from each other. It stands 55 stories high and is one of the tallest skyscrapers in the Philippines.




The tower is elliptical in shape and is built using the usual steel and glaze. Balconies are built at the peak of the tower. The bulk of the tower is covered in a blue tinted glaze but clear glazing covers the roof.

The facade overrun allows the using of a rooftop pool and a decking area. The top of the tower also features two levels.
