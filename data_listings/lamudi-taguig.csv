The interior design language of Aurelia Residences is as much about the interrelations of space as it is about fine details and decorative elements.

Drawing on inspiration from sources as diverse as Hispanic Villas, Filipino tiling patterns, and Italian cultural artifacts, the designers have deftly woven together spaces of both impressive grandeur and cozy intimacy, culminating in an understated Italian luxury that is brilliantly adapted to the context of the city and its people.

From the first step under the canopy, you are immediately immersed into the journey and experience that is Aurelia.

Overview of the Project
Avant at The Fort is a 38-storey premium residential tower by Vista Residences (Brittany/Vista Land), completed in 2013. Positioned at the prime intersection of 26th Street and 3rd Avenue, Crescent Park West, this building is acclaimed as the Philippines’ first green condominium, blending sustainable design with upscale city living.
Avant at The Fort redefines upscale residential living in BGC by merging sustainable design, luxurious finishes, and urban convenience into a cohesive, serene community. With its green architecture, varied unit types, curated amenities, and prime location, Avant stands out as a premium sanctuary in the bustling center of Taguig.

Key Building Features
Rising 38 storeys above Crescent Park West in Bonifacio Global City, Avant at The Fort stands as a pioneering symbol of sustainable luxury in Metro Manila. Conceived by Vista Residences and designed by ASYA Design Partners under Albert Yu, this development is widely recognized as the Philippines’ first true green condominium. It seamlessly melds eco-conscious architecture with upscale residential living, resulting in a structure that is as thoughtful in function as it is sleek in form
Avant at The Fort exemplifies a refined balance between green architecture and premium urban living. Its innovative sustainable design—a pioneering orientation, heat-reflective glazing, passive ventilation, verdant amenities, and biophilic integration—works in harmony with its sleek, low-density layout and upscale resident services. In doing so, it presents a new paradigm for luxury condominiums in Metro Manila by proving that environmental responsibility, thoughtful design, and elevated living can thrive together in urban high-rises.

Each condominium unit has a thru-view living and dining area that provides city view on one side and golf course view on the other. Each tower has its own helipad on its roof for use by its residents as well as for emergency evacuation purposes. The North Tower has an undulating curve as its facade; the South Tower is shaped like a crescent. Each tower incorporates a sheer wall on its narrow end that wraps up over the rooftop; this not only adds visual drama, but also conceals mechanical equipment housed on the roof. Contrasting eyebrow configurations on each building create a dynamic juxtaposition of visual elements. The complex includes an atrium space with a skylight; a meditation room for residents’ use overlooks the lush, landscaped garden and waterfall that front the property.

The Venice Luxury Residences
McKinley Hill
The Venice Luxury Residences, inspired by its namesake location, incorporates Venetian architecture and landscapes, including a grand canal that flows through the township center. The Venetian inspiration takes root in the buildings' exterior, resembling the shape of a ferro–a gondola's uniquely shaped iron head.

Each of the seven towers is also intricately built and embraced in lush greenery. Inside, the Italian ambiance continues with a grand lobby that is complemented by high ceilings and tall curtain glass. The seven towers share a podium-level amenity area that includes landscaped gardens, a swimming pool complex, sauna and jacuzzi, and a fitness station.
