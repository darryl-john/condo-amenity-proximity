The Venice Luxury Residences
McKinley Hill
The Venice Luxury Residences, inspired by its namesake location, incorporates Venetian architecture and landscapes, including a grand canal that flows through the township center. The Venetian inspiration takes root in the buildings' exterior, resembling the shape of a ferro–a gondola's uniquely shaped iron head.

Each of the seven towers is also intricately built and embraced in lush greenery. Inside, the Italian ambiance continues with a grand lobby that is complemented by high ceilings and tall curtain glass. The seven towers share a podium-level amenity area that includes landscaped gardens, a swimming pool complex, sauna and jacuzzi, and a fitness station.

 Ultra-Luxury Penthouse Bi-Level Unit for Sale in Two Roxas Triangle, Makati City
 Welcome to Two Roxas Triangle !
 

 Roxas Triangle Towers is a two-tower development piercing the skyline at the heart of a great city.
 

 The Two Roxas Triangle units are also clear manifestations of its rarity. The entire 52-level tower only contains a total of 182 units. Its exclusivity is even raised by several notches as each floor only has four units in comparison with a typical high-end building that has about 10 to 12 units.
 

 The smallest unit at the tower is 302 sq m, and the biggest cut expands all the way to 550 sq m. Furthermore, the tower’s garden level has two units. Standard units are then located from the fourth to the 41st floor. Higher than these floors is what the developers call the sky units. Beyond the sky are the penthouses, four of which are bi-level and three are flats.
 

 The design of Two Roxas Tower is consistent with the first tower—the unit layouts to an extent the façade design.
 

 Unit Features:
 Bi-level
 High-ceiling
 Facing Urdaneta Village
 4 bedrooms
 4 bathrooms
 Family area
 Show kitchen
 Auxiliary kitchen
 4 parking slots

Ultra-Luxury Bi-Level Penthouse For Sale in Two Roxas Triangle, Makati City




Welcome to Two Roxas Triangle!




Roxas Triangle Towers is a two-tower development piercing the skyline at the heart of a great city.




The Two Roxas Triangle units are also clear manifestations of its rarity. The entire 52-level tower only contains a total of 182 units. Its exclusivity is even raised by several notches as each floor only has four units in comparison with a typical high-end building that has about 10 to 12 units.




The smallest unit at the tower is 302 sq m, and the biggest cut expands all the way to 550 sq m. Furthermore, the tower’s garden level has two units. Standard units are then located from the fourth to the 41st floor. Higher than these floors is what the developers call the sky units. Beyond the sky are the penthouses, four of which are bi-level and three are flats.




The design of Two Roxas Tower is consistent with the first tower—the unit layouts to an extent the façade design.
